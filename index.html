      <p>This document describes a common data model and a REST API for the Web of Things. The Thing Description provides a vocabulary for describing physical devices connected to the World Wide Web in a machine readable format with a default JSON encoding. The Web Thing API provides a web services based programming interface with a RESTful design for applications to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and subscribe to events representing a change in state. A default HTTP + WebSockets binding of the Web Thing API is included in this specification.</p>
      <p>In addition to this specification there is a note on <a href="#">Web Thing API Protocol Bindings</a> which proposes non-normative bindings of the Web Thing API to various existing IoT protocols. There is also a document describing <a href="#">Web of Things Integration Patterns</a> which provides advice on different design patterns for integrating connected devices with the Web of Things, and where each pattern is most appropriate.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The goal of the Web of Things is to extend the web of pages into a web of things by giving connected devices URLs on the World Wide Web. This will allow the web to be used as a unifying application layer for a decentralized Internet of Things.</p>
      <p>Whilst web technologies are already in widespread use on the Internet of Things, this is currently done with mostly proprietary data formats and APIs which require per-vendor integrations to make devices interoperable. In order to promote ad-hoc interoperability on the Internet of Things a shared vocabulary and common API is needed.</p>
      <p>In this document we propose a common data model and REST API for the Web of Things.</p>

      <section>
        <h3><code>name</code> member</h3>
        <p>The name member is a user friendly string which describes the device. This can be set to any value by the device creator and may include a brand name or model number.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>type</code> member</h3>
        <p>The type member defines the type of device described by the Thing Description. See "Device Types" for possible values.</p>
        <div class="note">In future a mechanism may be put in place to allow this property to be extended with additional names not described in this specification using a schema based system.</div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>description</code> member</h3>
        <p>The description member is a user friendly string which describes the device and its functions. This can be set to any value by the device creator.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>properties</code> member</h3>
        <p>The properties member is a map of property objects which describe the attributes of the device.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>actions</code> member</h3>
        <p>The actions member is a map of action objects which describe functions that can be carried out on a device. Actions are used when the setting of properties is not sufficient to affect a required change in state. This may be used to describe a function which manipulates multiple properties or accepts arguments and has a different effect depending on which arguments are provided. An example might include a "reboot" action which power cycles a device.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>events</code> member</h3>
        <p>The events member is a map of event objects which define the types of events which may be emitted by a device. Events can be used where subscribing to a change in property state is not sufficient. This may be used to monitor changes in multiple properties or events which describe something other than a property change. An example might be an event which is emitted when a device is about to reboot.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Property</code> object</h3>
        <p>A property object describes an attribute of a Thing and is indexed by a property name. A property description may include its type, unit, description and URL.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Action</code> object</h3>
        <p>An action object describes a function which can be carried out on a device. An action description may include action parameters and a human friendly description which describes what the action does.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Event</code> object</h3>
        <p>An event object describes a type of event which may be emitted by a device. This may include the type of values which may be included in the event and a human friendly description which describes what the event means.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Alternative Encodings</h3>
        <p>The default encoding for the Thing description is JSON, but other encodings such as XML, JSON-LD or CBOR may be used. Alternative encodings are beyond the scope of this specification but may be defined separately.</p>
        <p>References to alternative available encodings may be provided using Link HTTP response headers with the alternate link relation. A client can express a preference for an alternative encoding using HTTP content negotiation.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Semantic Extensions</h3>
        <div class="note">In future a mechanism may be defined to add semantic extensions to a Thing Description which go beyond the taxonomy described in this specification.</div>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Web Thing API</h2>
        <p>The Web Thing API provides a web services based programming interface with a RESTful design for applications to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and subscribe to events representing a change in state. A default HTTP + WebSockets protocol binding is defined here.</p>
        <p>The Web Thing API consists of a number of different types of resources which represent different aspects of a device and can be independently referenced by a URL. The specific URLs and URL structure of resources are defined by the author of a Thing Description using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> approach. This specification does <strong>not</strong> define a fixed URL structure.</p>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Thing</code> resource</h3>
        <p>A Thing Resource provides a Thing Description of a device including its name, type, description, properties, actions and events. A Thing Resource is considered the root resource of a Thing.</p>
        <p>A Thing description is usually read only. An HTTP GET request can be used to retrieve a Thing Description for a Thing.</p>
        <p><strong>Example: Get a description of a Thing</strong></p>
        <div class="example">

      <h3><code>Property</code> resource</h3>
      <p>A property resource represents a property of a device. Some property resources may be read only and some may be writable. The value of a property can be retrieved with an HTTP GET request and updated with an HTTP PUT request. Changes in the value of a property can also be subscribed to by upgrading an HTTP request to a WebSocket.</p>

      <h3><code>Actions</code> resource</h3>
      <p>An actions resource represents a queue of actions to be executed on a device. A new action is created in the queue with an HTTP POST request and can be deleted from the queue with an HTTP DELETE request. The current status of an action request can be retrieved with an HTTP GET request and updated with an HTTP PUT request.</p>
      <p><strong>Example: Request an action</strong></p>

      <p>Guidance for both types of bindings is provided in a separate note called <a href="#">Web Thing API Protocol Bindings</a>.</p>
